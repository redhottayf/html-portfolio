<h1> The Best Movies According to Tayfun YARDIM </h1> 

<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>

<hr>

<h3> There will be blood </h3>

<p> This is is the best movie that I have ever been watched. Since it is addressing the effect of religion on the people. Also, you can see the conflict between pragmatist and oppurtinist people or at some point, how to manipulate the religious feelings by opportunism... </p>

<h3> Fight Club </h3>

<p> This is the second best movie that I have ever watched. since it exposes the bipolar behaviour or personality clash inside a person and we can see what are the consequences of this issue in the end.  </p>

<h3> Shawshank Redemption </h3>

<p> This is the third best movie that I have ever watched. since it is the movie that exposes an introvert person's world. What kind of challenges they can face and how they react to those challenges. also, it shows the patience and intelligence of those people.  </p>
